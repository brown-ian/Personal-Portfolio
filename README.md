## About Me
My name is Ian Brown and I am a recent graduate of Grinnell College. At grinnell I double majored in Computer Science and Economics. Outside of class I practiced and played baseball for the Grinnell Pioneers. I played first base for the Pio's for four years. While in class, I gained a love for problem solving and data analysis. This is something I picked up which studying in my focused disciplines.

## Projects
### **1. CSC-324 Individual Project (Netflix User Data Visualized)**
**Understanding Netflix User Data in the UK** <br />
This is my individual project for Grinnell College's CSC-324 course.<br /> 

**Accessing App:** <br />
Visit: https://brownian.shinyapps.io/final_indy_project_app/<br />

**Brief Description of the Project: ** <br />
The premise of this project is to learn how to use the R language as well as the shinyapps interface to visualize datasets. The datasets that I chose to use collected data from UK Netflix users. I paired this with the titles avaiable on Netflix during the time of the study, and correlated what times, dates, and movied were the most watched across the specified time period. 

**Use Cases:** <br />
This project is an example of how different visualizations can be used to interpret data. <br />

**Personal Interest**<br />
I found interest in this topic due to my use of streaming services. I was always curtious if certain titles drew more viewers to certain platforms, and given that there are constant bidding wars between firms for certain titles, I wanted to know the extent to which this was the case. <br />

**The Next Steps**<br />
Moving forward, this data could be expanded and turned into a predictive algorithm. This would require more in-depth analysis of genre, actors, movie lenghth, etc. However, with this information, one could predict what films would perform the best and bring in the most viewers for a streaming service.<br />  

### **2. CSC-324 Group Project (GCIEL)**

### **3. CSC-312 Final Course Project (TypeScript to Python Compiler)**
**Typescript-to-Python Compiler Design**<br />
This is my final project for Grinnell College's CSC-312 course. <br />

**Brief Description of Language:**<br /> 
This compiler project will be fairly straight forward. I want to create a compilar that will be written in typescript as to follow the class closely, but will also be able to translte into python code. This will functionally allow one to perform the same functions as in python but within the typescript framework. <br />

**Use Cases:**<br />
This compiler can be used to translate as seen in class scheme language into the python framework. This said, it does not work for functions. I have struggled with this syntactic aspect for quite some time. And it has befallen to me, I am un-able to complete this aspect of the project in the time allotted. That being said this compler works for assignments and definitions, as well as the translation of records and fields from our language into python. <br />

**Personal Interest**<br />
This peaked my interest heavily when it was discussed in class this past week. As someone who is still a novice programmer, I have had limited experience with programming languages, and one that I want to learn is python. So I figured that if I want to learn about the language, the best way to do it would be to write that language in another language I dont know very well (TypeScript). This to me is a serious challenge, but I think it will be very beneficial for those reasons. <br />

**The Next Steps** <br />
Moving forward, the idea would be to complete the compiler in its entirety. This would mean completing the required functions agreement, and furthermore, continuing on and adding prototype based objects. <br />


### **4. CSC-213 Final Project (Peer-to-Peer Encrypted Chat)**
**Peer-to-Peer Encrypted Chat**<br />
This is my final project for Grinnell College's CSC-213 course. <br />

**Brief Description of the Chat: **<br />
This chat room is designed around a regular peer-to-peer chat connection between different servers. The lead server creates the chat room, activates the encryption, then invites others to join. Once other join, the chat remains encrypted for the new users until they are given the decryption phrase from the lead. This only decrypts the chat for the user who activated this command. Others remain encrypted. All future communication between decrypted user and lead will be un-encrypted.  <br />

**Use Cases:**<br />
The use for this application is derived from the security layer of chat groups. This adds an extra layer of security to said chat room, and allows for the owner to spead to individuals alone while others are still present in the chat room. Given this extra layer of security, in the off chance that an unwanted party were to enter the chat room, they still would not be able to understand the conversation taking place. <br />

**Personal Interest**<br />
Character manipulation has always been an interest of mine, and one thing I loved to do early in my programming career was to manipulate texts to find certain words, sayings, or just to count the times a character was used. I also love to solve puzzles and a part of that is creating puzzles. Therefore, when the chance came to create an encrypted chat, that would require in-depth opperating system knowledge as well as problem solving skills, I jumped at the opportunity. <br />

**The Next Steps**<br />
Moving forward, the idea could be applied to a bigger scale. This would involve a propper UI/IX interface to run the chat from, as well as a much more in-depth and creative encryption method.  <br />
