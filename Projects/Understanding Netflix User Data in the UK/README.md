# Understanding Netflix User Data in the UK
This is my individual project for Grinnell College's CSC-324 course.

## Brief Description of the Project: 
The premise of this project is to learn how to use the R language as well as the shinyapps interface to visualize datasets. The datasets that I chose to use collected data from UK Netflix users. I paired this with the titles avaiable on Netflix during the time of the study, and correlated what times, dates, and movied were the most watched across the specified time period. 
## Use Cases:
This project is an example of how different visualizations can be used to interpret data. 
## Personal Interest
I found interest in this topic due to my use of streaming services. I was always curtious if certain titles drew more viewers to certain platforms, and given that there are constant bidding wars between firms for certain titles, I wanted to know the extent to which this was the case. 
## The Next Steps
Moving forward, this data could be expanded and turned into a predictive algorithm. This would require more in-depth analysis of genre, actors, movie lenghth, etc. However, with this information, one could predict what films would perform the best and bring in the most viewers for a streaming service.
