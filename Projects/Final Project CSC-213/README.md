## Brief Description of the Chat: 
 
## Use Cases:
This compiler can be used to translate as seen in class scheme language into the python framework. This said, it does not work for functions. I have struggled with this syntactic aspect for quite some time. And it has befallen to me, I am un-able to complete this aspect of the project in the time allotted. That being said this compler works for assignments and definitions, as well as the translation of records and fields from our language into python. 
## Personal Interest
This peaked my interest heavily when it was discussed in class this past week. As someone who is still a novice programmer, I have had limited experience with programming languages, and one that I want to learn is python. So I figured that if I want to learn about the language, the best way to do it would be to write that language in another language I dont know very well (TypeScript). This to me is a serious challenge, but I think it will be very beneficial for those reasons. 
## The Next Steps
Moving forward, the idea would be to complete the compiler in its entirety. This would mean completing the required functions agreement, and furthermore, continuing on and adding prototype based objects.
